# Crazy-OCR :eyes: :zap:

Welcome to **Crazy-OCR**! :wave: Your one-stop destination for all your OCR needs. This repository contains a robust and versatile OCR pipeline I developed while working on ID Cards for KYC. Feel free to explore, clone, or fork! 

## What's Inside :mag_right:
This repository houses a comprehensive set of OCR tools that I developed, including (but not limited to) the following features:

1. **Deskewing** :straight_ruler: - A useful tool for aligning images for better analysis.
2. **Edge detection** :triangular_ruler: - An algorithm designed to detect and highlight edges in your image.
3. **Contour Detection** :loop: - A feature that detects and isolates contours in your image.
4. **Rotation** :recycle: - A handy tool to adjust the orientation of your images.
5. **Adaptive Thresholding** :low_brightness: - This feature is to adjust the threshold level adaptively to make your image clearer.
6. **Multi image/file format compatibility** :file_folder: - Accepts and processes a wide variety of file formats for your convenience.
7. **Regex matching for FIN & DOB** :1234: - This tool helps in extracting and validating Financial Information Numbers (FIN) and Date of Birth (DOB) details.
8. **Interactive Morphing** :sparkles: - A feature to interactively morph your images.
9. **Interactive Image Intensity correction** :bulb: - An interactive tool to correct the intensity of your image for better visibility.
10. **Angle Correction** :level_slider: - This feature corrects any angular distortions in your images.
11. **Auto Deskew looping through an entire folder of images** :repeat: - Automates the deskewing process for a whole folder of images.
12. **ID CARD Image preprocessing** :credit_card: - A specific tool designed for pre-processing of ID card images.
